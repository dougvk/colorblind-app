## Troubleshooting Guide

### Native Module Issues
If you encounter "Cannot find native module" errors:
1. Stop the development server
2. Clear Expo cache and restart:
   ```bash
   npx expo start -c
   ```

### Development Build Setup
When adding native modules that aren't supported in Expo Go:
1. Install dev client:
   ```bash
   npx expo install expo-dev-client
   ```
2. Create native builds:
   ```bash
   npx expo prebuild
   ```
3. Run on simulator/device:
   ```bash
   npx expo run:ios
   # or
   npx expo run:android
   ```

### Common Issues
- Always restart development server after installing new packages
- Use development builds for native modules not supported in Expo Go
- Clear Metro bundler cache if changes aren't reflecting
- Check iOS/Android specific setup requirements for native modules
